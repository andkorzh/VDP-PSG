# Notes on Topology

The cells were set up and connected by hand. A fitter can't do that beautifully, and a router can't connect them.

The man did it.

And the cells are stacked modularly (which is exactly what @nukeykt shows in the pictures - the counters separately, registers separately, etc.).

VDP is CMOS with one layer of metal.

Another unusual feature is the use of n-pockets instead of the usual p:

When reversing, you don't need to pay attention to this. Where ground is on the N side, where VDD is on the P side, the usual rules for CMOS.

## Group of self-alignment cells

In some places you find this (the ground below):

It would seem to be two `or` cells, but no.

The self-alignment group (cell `or`):

|ident (ground bottom)|rot (ground up)|flip_h (ground bottom)|rot+flip_h (ground up)|
|---|---|---|---|

I.e. it is clear that the cell cannot be rotated upwards (because they are stacked in rows) and cannot be flipped vertically (bottom-up), because in this case we get the picture that was shown in the beginning.

The `or` cell flipped vertically changes the N and P transistors, leaving the ground, so it becomes the `and` cell.

Therefore the `and` cell will have such a self-switched group:

|ident (ground bottom)|rot (ground up)|flip_h (ground bottom)|rot+flip_h (ground up)|
|---|---|---|---|

Not all cells allow such tricks, but only complementarily symmetric ones like nor / nand, or / and.

The self-alignment group of cells is the simplest group of the dihedral D2 (`Vierergruppe`).
